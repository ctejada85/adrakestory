- ✅ Fixed thread safety issues with file dialog receiver

### Known Technical Debt
- Some placeholder implementations (marked with TODO)
- No async file operations for very large files (save is synchronous)
- No auto-save feature yet
- Grid rendering could be optimized for very large maps
- Camera controls could have smoother interpolation
- No LOD system for distant voxels yet

### Performance Considerations
- Current implementation handles maps up to 100x100x100 voxels
- Grid rendering is immediate mode (could be cached)
- No LOD system for distant voxels yet

## 📝 Notes

- The architecture is solid and extensible
- Code is well-organized and documented
- Most complex systems are implemented
- Remaining work is mostly integration and polish
- Foundation is ready for additional features
