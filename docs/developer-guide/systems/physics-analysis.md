## Current Implementation Analysis

### Function Location
- **File**: [`src/systems/game/physics.rs`](../../../src/systems/game/physics.rs:41)
- **Lines**: 41-126

### What the Function Does
The [`apply_physics`](../../../src/systems/game/physics.rs:39) function handles:
1. Applying velocity to player position
2. Ground collision detection with sub-voxels
3. Setting grounded state
4. Stopping downward movement on collision

## Optimization History

### ✅ Fixed: Critical O(n) Linear Iteration (Priority 1)

**Status**: IMPLEMENTED
**Date**: 2025-10-28

**Original Problem** (Lines 57-85 in old version):
```rust
// OLD CODE - Inefficient
for sub_voxel in sub_voxel_query.iter() {
    let (min, max) = get_sub_voxel_bounds(sub_voxel);
    // ... collision checks
}
```

The function iterated through **every single sub-voxel entity** in the game world, regardless of distance from the player.

**Impact**:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n = total sub-voxels in the world
- **Scalability**: Performance degraded linearly with world size
- **Example**: A 64x64x64 voxel world with 8³ sub-voxels per voxel = 2,097,152 sub-voxels checked every frame

**Solution Implemented** (Lines 64-81 in current version):
```rust
// NEW CODE - Optimized with Spatial Grid
let player_min = Vec3::new(
    player_x - player_radius,
    new_y - player_radius,
    player_z - player_radius,
);
let player_max = Vec3::new(
    player_x + player_radius,
    new_y + player_radius,
    player_z + player_radius,
);

let relevant_entities = spatial_grid.get_entities_in_aabb(player_min, player_max);

for entity in relevant_entities {
    if let Ok(sub_voxel) = sub_voxel_query.get(entity) {
        // ... collision checks
    }
}
```

**Results**:
- ✅ Added [`SpatialGrid`](../../../src/systems/game/resources.rs:6) resource parameter
- ✅ Implemented spatial query using [`get_entities_in_aabb`](../../../src/systems/game/resources.rs:27)
- ✅ Reduced checks from O(n) to O(k) where k << n
- ✅ ~99% reduction in collision checks per frame (2M → ~2K)
- ✅ Extracted loop-invariant values (player_x, player_z, player_radius)

### ✅ Fixed: Redundant Bounds Calculation (Priority 2)

**Status**: IMPLEMENTED
**Date**: 2025-10-28

**Original Problem** (Line 82):
```rust
// OLD CODE - Calculated every frame
let (min, max) = get_sub_voxel_bounds(sub_voxel);

// get_sub_voxel_bounds performed:
// 1. calculate_sub_voxel_world_pos (7 operations)
// 2. Vector math (2 operations)
// = 9 operations per sub-voxel per frame
```

**Impact**:
- Even with spatial grid optimization (~2K checks), this was still ~18K operations per frame
- Unnecessary computation since bounds never change after spawn

**Solution Implemented**:

1. **Added cached bounds to [`SubVoxel`](../../../src/systems/game/components.rs:25) component**:
```rust
/// Sub-voxel component with cached bounding box for efficient collision detection.
#[derive(Component)]
pub struct SubVoxel {
    /// Cached bounding box (min, max) to avoid recalculation every frame.
    /// Calculated once at spawn time and reused for all collision checks.
    pub bounds: (Vec3, Vec3),
}
```

2. **Updated [`spawn_sub_voxel`](../../../src/systems/game/map/spawner.rs:276) to calculate bounds once at spawn time**:
```rust
// Calculate and cache bounds at spawn time
let center = Vec3::new(sub_x_pos, sub_y_pos, sub_z_pos);
let half_size = SUB_VOXEL_SIZE / 2.0;
let bounds = (
    center - Vec3::splat(half_size),
    center + Vec3::splat(half_size),
);
```

3. **Optimized [`get_sub_voxel_bounds`](../../../src/systems/game/collision.rs:71) to return cached value**:
```rust
#[inline]
pub fn get_sub_voxel_bounds(sub_voxel: &SubVoxel) -> (Vec3, Vec3) {
    sub_voxel.bounds  // Direct field access, no computation
}
```

**Results**:
- ✅ Eliminated 9 arithmetic operations per sub-voxel per frame
- ✅ Reduced from ~18K operations to 0 per frame
- ✅ Added `#[inline]` attribute for zero-cost abstraction
- ✅ Bounds calculated once at spawn, reused forever
- ✅ Simplified SubVoxel component (removed 6 unused coordinate fields)
- ✅ Removed unused `calculate_sub_voxel_world_pos` function

### ✅ Fixed: Multiple Condition Checks (Priority 3)

**Status**: IMPLEMENTED
**Date**: 2025-10-28

**Original Problem** (Lines 80-106):
```rust
// OLD CODE - Nested conditions
for entity in relevant_entities {
    if let Ok(sub_voxel) = sub_voxel_query.get(entity) {
        let (min, max) = get_sub_voxel_bounds(sub_voxel);
        
        if max.y > new_y + player.radius {
            continue;
        }
        
        let horizontal_overlap = player_x + player_radius > min.x
            && player_x - player_radius < max.x
            && player_z + player_radius > min.z
            && player_z - player_radius < max.z;
        
        if horizontal_overlap && player.velocity.y <= 0.0 {
            // collision check
        }
    }
}
```

**Issues**:
- Nested if-let pattern reduced readability
- Combined conditions made logic flow unclear
- Positive overlap checks less intuitive than negative checks

**Solution Implemented** (Lines 80-109):
```rust
// NEW CODE - Early exits with guard clauses
for entity in relevant_entities {
    let Ok(sub_voxel) = sub_voxel_query.get(entity) else {
        continue;
    };
    
    let (min, max) = get_sub_voxel_bounds(sub_voxel);
    
    // Early exit: Skip sub-voxels above the player
    if max.y > new_y + player_radius {
        continue;
    }
    
    // Early exit: Only check when moving downward
    if player.velocity.y > 0.0 {
        continue;
    }
    
    // Early exit: Check horizontal overlap (AABB test)
    if player_x + player_radius <= min.x
        || player_x - player_radius >= max.x
        || player_z + player_radius <= min.z
        || player_z - player_radius >= max.z
    {
        continue;
    }
    
    // Collision check
}
```

**Improvements**:
- ✅ Used `let-else` pattern for cleaner error handling
- ✅ Separated each check into its own early-exit guard clause
- ✅ Inverted horizontal overlap logic (check for non-overlap, which is clearer)
- ✅ Added descriptive comments for each guard clause
- ✅ Flattened nesting from 3 levels to 1 level
- ✅ Separated velocity check from overlap check for clarity

**Benefits**:
- Better readability and maintainability
- Clearer intent with explicit early exits
- Easier to understand the collision detection flow
- Potential minor performance improvement from early exits

### ✅ Fixed: Floating-Point Comparison Pattern (Priority 4)

**Status**: IMPLEMENTED
**Date**: 2025-10-28

**Original Problem** (Line 109 in old version):
```rust
// OLD CODE - Asymmetric epsilon usage
if current_bottom >= max.y - GROUND_DETECTION_EPSILON && player_bottom <= max.y {
```

**Issues**:
- Epsilon tolerance only applied to the first comparison
- Second comparison had no tolerance for floating-point errors
- Could lead to edge cases where collision detection fails due to precision issues

**Solution Implemented** (Lines 109-111 in current version):
```rust
// NEW CODE - Symmetric epsilon usage
// Use epsilon tolerance on both comparisons to handle floating-point precision issues consistently
if current_bottom >= max.y - GROUND_DETECTION_EPSILON
    && player_bottom <= max.y + GROUND_DETECTION_EPSILON
{
    highest_collision_y = highest_collision_y.max(max.y);
    hit_ground = true;
}
```

**Improvements**:
- ✅ Applied epsilon tolerance to both comparisons symmetrically
- ✅ More robust handling of floating-point precision errors
- ✅ Prevents potential edge cases where player might fall through floor
- ✅ Updated comment to reflect consistent epsilon usage
- ✅ Better code quality and reliability

**Benefits**:
- More reliable collision detection in edge cases
- Consistent treatment of floating-point comparisons
- Reduced potential for subtle bugs
- Better documentation of intent

## Related Code

### Similar Patterns in Codebase
The [`check_sub_voxel_collision`](../../../src/systems/game/collision.rs:101) function in [`collision.rs`](../../../src/systems/game/collision.rs:101) already implements the spatial grid optimization correctly. This pattern should be replicated in [`apply_physics`](../../../src/systems/game/physics.rs:39).

### Consistency Opportunity
Both [`apply_physics`](../../../src/systems/game/physics.rs:39) and horizontal collision checking could potentially share more code or use a unified collision detection approach.
