# Map Editor Open Function Fix

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive fix implemented for the map editor's "Open" feature, including file dialog functionality, UI responsiveness, and map rendering.

## Problem Description

### Problem 1: Non-Functional Open Button
The map editor's "Open" button and menu item were not working. When clicked, they would only log a message to the console and immediately close the dialog without actually opening a file picker or loading any map files.

### Problem 2: UI Blocking ("Not Responding")
After implementing the initial fix, the application would become unresponsive ("not responding") when the Open button was clicked because the file dialog was blocking the main UI thread.

### Problem 3: Maps Not Rendering
Even after successfully loading a map file, the voxels were not visible in the 3D viewport. The map data was loaded into `EditorState` but no 3D meshes were spawned.

### Root Causes
1. **Initial Issue**: The `handle_file_operations` function in [`src/editor/ui/dialogs.rs`](../../../../src/editor/ui/dialogs.rs) was just a placeholder
2. **Blocking Issue**: The `rfd::FileDialog::pick_file()` call was synchronous and blocked the main thread
3. **Rendering Issue**: No system existed to spawn voxel meshes from loaded map data

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Non-Blocking File Dialog (Thread-Based)
- Spawns file dialog in a separate thread to prevent UI blocking
- Uses Rust's `std::sync::mpsc` channels for thread communication
- Wraps receiver in `Arc<Mutex<>>` for thread-safe access
- Implements Bevy event system for result handling

### 2. File Dialog Integration
- Integrated the `rfd` (Rust File Dialog) crate to provide native file picker functionality
- Added file type filtering to only show `.ron` files
- Implemented proper dialog title and user experience
- File dialog runs asynchronously without freezing the UI

### 3. File Loading Logic
- Added `load_map_from_file()` function to read and parse RON map files
- Implemented proper error handling for:
  - File I/O errors (file not found, permission denied, etc.)
  - RON parsing errors (invalid syntax, missing fields, etc.)
  - Map validation errors (invalid dimensions, etc.)

### 4. State Management
- Added `error_dialog_open` and `error_message` fields to `EditorUIState`
- Added `FileDialogReceiver` resource to track pending file dialog
- Added `FileSelectedEvent` for communicating file selection results
- Implemented error dialog UI to display user-friendly error messages
- Updated editor state properly when a map is successfully loaded:
  - Sets `current_map` to the loaded map data
  - Sets `file_path` to the opened file path
  - Clears the modified flag
  - Clears any existing selections

### 5. User Feedback
- Success: Map loads silently with console log confirmation
- Failure: Error dialog displays with detailed error message
- File path is tracked for future save operations
- UI remains responsive during file selection

## Solution Implemented

### Part 1: Non-Blocking File Dialog (Thread-Based)
- Spawns file dialog in a separate thread to prevent UI blocking
- Uses Rust's `std::sync::mpsc` channels for thread communication
- Wraps receiver in `Arc<Mutex<>>` for thread-safe access
- Implements Bevy event system for result handling

### Part 2: Map Rendering System
- Created [`src/editor/renderer.rs`](../../../../src/editor/renderer.rs) module
- Implements automatic voxel spawning when maps are loaded
- Detects map changes and triggers re-rendering
- Supports all voxel patterns (Full, Platform, Staircase, Pillar)
- Properly cleans up old voxels before spawning new ones

## Files Modified/Created

### [`src/editor/renderer.rs`](../../../../src/editor/renderer.rs) (NEW - 213 lines)
- `EditorVoxel` component: Marker for editor-spawned voxels
- `MapRenderState` resource: Tracks rendering state and voxel count
- `RenderMapEvent` event: Signals when map should be re-rendered
- `detect_map_changes()` system: Monitors for map data changes
- `render_map_system()` system: Spawns/despawns voxel meshes
- Voxel pattern functions: `spawn_full_voxel()`, `spawn_platform_voxel()`, etc.
- `spawn_sub_voxel()` function: Creates individual sub-voxel meshes

### [`src/editor/ui/dialogs.rs`](../../../../src/editor/ui/dialogs.rs)
- Added imports: `std::fs`, `std::path::PathBuf`, `std::sync::{mpsc, Arc, Mutex}`
- Added `FileSelectedEvent` event type
- Added `FileDialogReceiver` resource for tracking file dialog state
- Added `render_error_dialog()` function
- Replaced blocking `handle_file_operations()` with non-blocking thread-based implementation

- Added `handle_file_selected()` system to process file selection events
- Added `load_map_from_file()` helper function

### [`src/editor/state.rs`](../../../../src/editor/state.rs)
- Added `error_dialog_open: bool` field to `EditorUIState`
- Added `error_message: String` field to `EditorUIState`

### [`src/editor/mod.rs`](../../../../src/editor/mod.rs)
- Added `pub mod renderer;`
- Exported `MapRenderState` and `RenderMapEvent`

### [`src/bin/map_editor.rs`](../../../../src/bin/map_editor.rs)
- Added renderer module import
- Added `MapRenderState` resource initialization
- Added `RenderMapEvent` event registration
- Added `detect_map_changes` system
- Added `render_map_system` system
- Updated `render_ui` function signature to include `FileDialogReceiver`

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing

1. **Build the map editor:**
   ```bash
   cargo build --bin map_editor --release
   ```

2. **Run the map editor:**
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin map_editor --release
   ```

3. **Test successful file opening:**
   - Click "File" ‚Üí "Open..." or click the "üìÅ Open" toolbar button
   - Navigate to `assets/maps/`
   - Select `default.ron` or `simple_test.ron`
   - Verify the map loads successfully
   - Check the console for: "Successfully loaded map from: ..."

4. **Test error handling:**
   - Try opening a non-existent file (should show error dialog)
   - Try opening an invalid RON file (should show parse error)
   - Try opening a text file with wrong extension (should be filtered out)

5. **Test unsaved changes workflow:**
   - Make changes to the current map (place a voxel)
   - Try to open a new file
   - Verify the "Unsaved Changes" dialog appears
   - Test all three options: Save, Don't Save, Cancel

### Expected Behavior

#### Success Case
- Native file dialog opens with `.ron` file filter
- User selects a valid map file
- Map loads into the editor
- Console shows: `Successfully loaded map from: <path>`
- Window title updates to show the filename
- Modified flag is cleared

#### Error Cases
- **File not found:** Error dialog shows "Failed to read file: ..."
- **Invalid RON syntax:** Error dialog shows "Failed to parse map file: ..."
- **Invalid dimensions:** Error dialog shows "Invalid map dimensions: ..."

## Technical Details

### Non-Blocking Architecture

```
User clicks Open
    ‚Üì
UI sets file_dialog_open flag
    ‚Üì
handle_file_operations() spawns thread
    ‚Üì
Thread opens file dialog (blocking in thread only)
    ‚Üì
User selects file
    ‚Üì
Thread sends result via channel
    ‚Üì
check_file_dialog_result() polls channel
    ‚Üì
FileSelectedEvent sent
    ‚Üì
handle_file_selected() loads map
    ‚Üì
Editor state updated
```

### File Dialog Configuration
```rust
std::thread::spawn(move || {
    let result = rfd::FileDialog::new()
        .add_filter("RON Map Files", &["ron"])
        .set_title("Open Map File")
        .pick_file();
    
    let _ = sender.send(result);
});
```

### Map Validation
The loader validates:
- File can be read (I/O check)
- Content is valid RON format (parse check)
- Map dimensions are non-zero (validation check)

### Error Handling Flow
```
User clicks Open
    ‚Üì
Thread spawned with file dialog
    ‚Üì
UI remains responsive
    ‚Üì
User selects file
    ‚Üì
Event sent to main thread
    ‚Üì
load_map_from_file() called
    ‚Üì
    ‚îú‚îÄ Success ‚Üí Update editor state
    ‚îî‚îÄ Error ‚Üí Show error dialog
```

### Thread Safety
- Uses `Arc<Mutex<Receiver>>` for thread-safe channel access
- Bevy's ECS handles synchronization automatically
- No data races or deadlocks possible

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future development:

1. **Recent Files List:** Track recently opened files for quick access
2. **File Watching:** Auto-reload when file changes externally
3. **Drag & Drop:** Support dragging .ron files into the editor
4. **Preview:** Show map preview in file dialog
5. **Async Loading:** Load large maps without blocking UI
6. **Backup Creation:** Auto-backup before loading new file
