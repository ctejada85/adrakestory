## Overview

A Drake's Story is an experimental 3D game exploring voxel-based world generation with high-resolution sub-voxel rendering (8Ã—8Ã—8 sub-voxels per voxel). Navigate through procedurally structured worlds with realistic physics, varied terrain types, and dynamic camera controls.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd adrakestory

# Build and run (release mode recommended)
cargo run --release
```

**First time?** See the [Installation Guide](docs/getting-started/installation.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Features

- **3D Voxel World** - High-detail sub-voxel rendering
- **Physics System** - Realistic gravity and collision detection
- **Varied Terrain** - Staircases, platforms, pillars, and solid blocks
- **Isometric Camera** - Dynamic camera with rotation controls
- **Map Loader** - Load custom maps from RON files with progress tracking
- **State Management** - Clean game flow through multiple states

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable)
- Platform-specific requirements:
  - **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools
  - **Linux**: Development libraries ([details](docs/getting-started/installation.md))
  - **Windows**: Visual Studio Build Tools

### Building

```bash
# Debug build (faster compilation)
cargo build

# Release build (better performance)
cargo build --release
```

### Running Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

### Debugging

See the [Debugging Guide](docs/developer-guide/debugging.md) for VSCode setup and debugging tips.

## Creating Custom Maps

Maps are defined in RON format in `assets/maps/`:

```ron
(
    metadata: (
        name: "My Map",
        author: "Your Name",
        version: "1.0.0",
        // ...
    ),
    world: (
        width: 10,
        height: 5,
        depth: 10,
        voxels: [
            (pos: (0, 0, 0), voxel_type: Grass, pattern: Some(Full)),
            // ...
        ],
    ),
    // ...
)
```
